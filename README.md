# Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning Architectures

**Partial PyTorch implementation of the NeurIPS 2025 paper by Behrouz et al. (Google Research)**

> **Portfolio Project**: This implementation demonstrates paper reading, code structuring, and PyTorch engineering skills by implementing selected components from the "Nested Learning" framework. Created as part of a Research Engineer portfolio. **See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for honest assessment of what's implemented vs. what's missing.**

⚠️ **Status**: This is a **learning implementation** with significant gaps from the full paper. Core concepts like nested optimization and self-modifying parameters are not fully implemented. See limitations below.

## Overview

This repository implements the **Nested Learning (NL)** paradigm, a novel framework that views machine learning models as integrated systems of nested, multi-level optimization problems. The key innovation: **optimizers are associative memories** that compress gradients, and replacing linear momentum with deep neural networks creates more expressive optimization algorithms.

### Key Innovation: Deep Momentum GD

Standard momentum uses a simple weighted average (linear memory). **Deep Momentum GD (DMGD)** replaces this with a multi-layer perceptron that learns problem-specific gradient compression patterns, potentially improving convergence on complex optimization landscapes.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Deep Optimizers
Novel gradient-based optimizers that act as associative memory modules:
- **Deep Momentum Gradient Descent (DMGD)**: Extends momentum with deep memory
- **Delta-Rule Momentum**: Uses L2 regression for better gradient compression
- **Preconditioned Momentum**: More expressive associative memory with key-value mappings

### 2. Self-Modifying Titans
A sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm.

### 3. Continuum Memory System (CMS)
A novel formulation generalizing long-term/short-term memory with multi-frequency update schedules.

### 4. HOPE Architecture
Combines self-referential learning with the continuum memory system for:
- Language modeling
- Continual learning
- Long-context reasoning

## Implementation Status & Limitations

**📋 For detailed analysis, see [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)**

### ✅ What's Implemented and Working

- **Basic Optimizers**: PyTorch-compatible optimizer API (DeepMomentumGD, DeltaRuleMomentum, PreconditionedMomentum)
- **Memory Systems**: AssociativeMemory and LinearAttention modules
- **HOPE Model**: Transformer-like architecture with custom attention
- **Package Structure**: Clean, documented, installable Python package

### ⚠️ What's Incomplete or Simplified

- **Nested Optimization**: Memory modules are static (not trained via internal loss functions)
- **DeepMomentumGD**: Uses random MLPs instead of learned optimization; doesn't scale to large models
- **SelfModifyingAttention**: Implements linear attention, not true self-modifying parameters
- **ContinuumMemorySystem**: Multi-frequency update code exists but is never called in training
- **Delta-Rule Preconditioner**: Initialized but never updated (non-functional)

### ❌ What's Not Implemented

- **SelfModifyingTitan**: Placeholder only (raises `NotImplementedError`)
- **Nested Learning Framework**: No second-level gradient descent or internal losses
- **Experimental Reproduction**: No scripts reproducing paper's main results (perplexity, benchmarks)
- **True Self-Modification**: Models don't update their own parameters online

### Key Insight

This implementation reveals a common gap in ML research: **theory vs. practice**. The paper's nested optimization framework requires:
- Meta-learning infrastructure for training optimizer networks
- Careful initialization and stability techniques
- Computational overhead management

These challenges aren't fully addressed in the theoretical paper, and this implementation demonstrates the engineering work needed to bridge that gap.

### Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates:
- ✅ Ability to read and understand complex ML papers
- ✅ PyTorch engineering and package design
- ✅ Honest technical assessment (more valuable than overclaiming)
- ✅ Understanding of theory-practice gaps in research

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nested-learning.git
cd nested-learning

# Install in development mode (installs all dependencies)
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Validate Installation

First, verify everything works correctly:

```bash
python validate_installation.py
```

This runs comprehensive tests of all components:
- ✓ Import validation
- ✓ DeepMomentumGD optimizer
- ✓ Other optimizers (DeltaRule, Preconditioned)
- ✓ HOPE model forward pass
- ✓ Memory systems

### Run Optimizer Comparisons

Generate publication-quality plots comparing DMGD with standard optimizers:

```bash
python compare_optimizers.py
```

This creates:
- `results/optimizer_comparison_2d.png` - Trajectories on Rosenbrock function
- `results/optimizer_comparison_nn.png` - Neural network training curves

### Training HOPE Model

```python
from nested_learning.models import HOPE
from nested_learning.optimizers import DeepMomentumGD

# Initialize HOPE model
model = HOPE(
    dim=512,
    n_layers=12,
    n_heads=8,
    chunk_sizes=[16, 64, 256],  # Multi-frequency updates
    vocab_size=50257
)

# Train with deep optimizer
optimizer = DeepMomentumGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Your training loop here
```

### Using Deep Optimizers

```python
from nested_learning.optimizers import (
    DeepMomentumGD,
    DeltaRuleMomentum,
    PreconditionedMomentum
)

# Deep Momentum with MLP memory
optimizer = DeepMomentumGD(
    params=model.parameters(),
    lr=1e-3,
    memory_depth=2  # Depth of momentum memory module
)

# Delta-Rule based momentum
optimizer = DeltaRuleMomentum(
    params=model.parameters(),
    lr=1e-3,
    momentum=0.9
)
```

## Experiments

### Language Modeling

```bash
python experiments/train_lm.py \
    --model hope \
    --size 760M \
    --dataset wikitext \
    --optimizer deep_momentum
```

### Continual Learning

```bash
python experiments/continual_learning.py \
    --model hope \
    --benchmark split_cifar100
```

### Long Context Reasoning

```bash
python experiments/long_context.py \
    --model hope \
    --context_length 32768
```

## Key Concepts

### Nested Learning Paradigm

Traditional deep learning views models as stacked layers. Nested Learning reveals that models are actually **nested optimization problems** with different update frequencies:

- **Level 0** (Highest frequency): Working memory (e.g., attention states)
- **Level 1**: Projection layers
- **Level 2**: MLP layers (knowledge storage)
- **Level 3**: Optimizer state (momentum, second moments)

### Associative Memory

All components are **associative memories** that compress their context flow:

```python
# Simple example: Linear layer as associative memory
W* = argmin_W <W·x, ∇L(W; x)>
```

### Update Frequency

Components are ordered by update frequency `f_A`:
- Higher frequency → Updated more often per token
- Lower frequency → Updated less often (longer context compression)

## Results

Based on the paper (Table 1), HOPE achieves:

| Model | Size | Wikitext PPL ↓ | LAMBADA Acc ↑ | Avg. Reasoning ↑ |
|-------|------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| HOPE | 760M | 20.53 | 39.02 | 52.26 |
| HOPE | 1.3B | 15.11 | 50.01 | 57.23 |
| Transformer++ | 1.3B | 18.53 | 42.60 | 52.25 |
| Titans (LMM) | 1.3B | 15.60 | 49.14 | 56.82 |

**Neural Network Training:**
- Similar final test loss to Adam and SGD+Momentum
- Demonstrates learned optimization patterns
