# Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning Architectures

**Complete PyTorch implementation of the NeurIPS 2025 paper by Behrouz et al. (Google Research)**

> **Portfolio Project**: This implementation demonstrates advanced ML research engineering by implementing the complete Nested Learning framework including nested optimization, meta-learning, multi-frequency memory systems, and self-modifying neural networks. **See [IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) for full technical details.**

✅ **Status**: **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION** - All core paper concepts implemented and working. Includes nested optimization with meta-learning, multi-frequency continuum memory training, and true self-modifying parameters.

## Overview

This repository implements the **Nested Learning (NL)** paradigm, a novel framework that views machine learning models as integrated systems of nested, multi-level optimization problems. The key innovation: **optimizers are associative memories** that compress gradients, and replacing linear momentum with deep neural networks creates more expressive optimization algorithms.

### Key Innovation: Deep Momentum GD

Standard momentum uses a simple weighted average (linear memory). **Deep Momentum GD (DMGD)** replaces this with a multi-layer perceptron that learns problem-specific gradient compression patterns, potentially improving convergence on complex optimization landscapes.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Deep Optimizers
Novel gradient-based optimizers that act as associative memory modules:
- **Deep Momentum Gradient Descent (DMGD)**: Extends momentum with deep memory
- **Delta-Rule Momentum**: Uses L2 regression for better gradient compression
- **Preconditioned Momentum**: More expressive associative memory with key-value mappings

### 2. Self-Modifying Titans
A sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm.

### 3. Continuum Memory System (CMS)
A novel formulation generalizing long-term/short-term memory with multi-frequency update schedules.

### 4. HOPE Architecture
Combines self-referential learning with the continuum memory system for:
- Language modeling
- Continual learning
- Long-context reasoning

from nested_learning.models import HOPE
from nested_learning.optimizers import DeepMomentumGD

# Initialize HOPE model
model = HOPE(
    dim=512,
    n_layers=12,
    n_heads=8,
    chunk_sizes=[16, 64, 256],  # Multi-frequency updates
    vocab_size=50257
)

# Train with deep optimizer
optimizer = DeepMomentumGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Your training loop here
```

### Using Deep Optimizers

```python
from nested_learning.optimizers import (
    DeepMomentumGD,
    DeltaRuleMomentum,
    PreconditionedMomentum
)

# Deep Momentum with MLP memory
optimizer = DeepMomentumGD(
    params=model.parameters(),
    lr=1e-3,
    memory_depth=2  # Depth of momentum memory module
)

# Delta-Rule based momentum
optimizer = DeltaRuleMomentum(
    params=model.parameters(),
    lr=1e-3,
    momentum=0.9
)
```

## Key Concepts

### Nested Learning Paradigm

Traditional deep learning views models as stacked layers. Nested Learning reveals that models are actually **nested optimization problems** with different update frequencies:

- **Level 0** (Highest frequency): Working memory (e.g., attention states)
- **Level 1**: Projection layers
- **Level 2**: MLP layers (knowledge storage)
- **Level 3**: Optimizer state (momentum, second moments)

### Associative Memory

All components are **associative memories** that compress their context flow:

```python
# Simple example: Linear layer as associative memory
W* = argmin_W <W·x, ∇L(W; x)>
```

### Update Frequency

Components are ordered by update frequency `f_A`:
- Higher frequency → Updated more often per token
- Lower frequency → Updated less often (longer context compression)

## Results

Based on the paper (Table 1), HOPE achieves:

| Model | Size | Wikitext PPL ↓ | LAMBADA Acc ↑ | Avg. Reasoning ↑ |
|-------|------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| HOPE | 760M | 20.53 | 39.02 | 52.26 |
| HOPE | 1.3B | 15.11 | 50.01 | 57.23 |
| Transformer++ | 1.3B | 18.53 | 42.60 | 52.25 |
